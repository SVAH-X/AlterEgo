# Processing Screen — Story Scroll Redesign

**Date:** 2026-04-25
**Branch:** `feature/processing-story-scroll`
**Worktree:** `.worktrees/processing-story-scroll`
**Scope:** `frontend/src/screens/screens-a.tsx` — `ScreenProcessing` (section 4 of the app)

## Problem

The processing screen feels rushed and the right-hand "story" column reads as subtle metadata, not as the main narrative. Two failure modes:

1. **Events overwrite each other mid-reveal.** When `/simulate` streams checkpoint events faster than the panel can render its bubbles (~2.4s for four bubbles at 600ms intervals), the active event is replaced by the next one before the user has time to read it. Text appears and vanishes.
2. **No transition between events.** A new `filledAt` swaps the active event instantly. There's no fade, no breath, no "the moment landed."
3. **Right column is visually outweighed by the left.** The constellation is glowing, animated, and central; the right column uses subdued text colors (`--ink-1`, `--ink-2`), 16px serif, and reads as a sidebar — but it carries the actual story.

## Goal

Make the processing phase read like a story being written in real time. The narrative is what the user pays attention to; the constellation becomes ambient context that supports it. Pacing is controlled, not LLM-bound.

## Non-goals

- No backend changes. The streaming pipeline (`/simulate` NDJSON phases) stays as-is.
- No layout changes outside the processing screen.
- Constellation visualization is preserved — not removed, not redesigned.
- Phase 1 (counting), phase 2 (plan), phase 4 (finalizing) layouts are unchanged. Only phase 3 (events) gets the scroll treatment and the typography pass applies to all four phases' right column.

## Approach: Story Scroll, paced by the reader

The right column becomes a vertical stream of completed checkpoints. New events flow in from the bottom; older events stay above at reduced opacity. **The user advances at their own pace** — once an event has finished revealing its bubbles, a quiet prompt invites them to press a key (or click) for the next beat. A long inactivity timeout exists only as a demo safety net.

### Component breakdown

The current right-column body is a phase-conditional `if/else` block. We split phase 3 into a dedicated `StoryScroll` component with three responsibilities, each independently understandable and testable:

1. **`useStoryQueue(outline)`** — hook that watches `outline` for newly-filled checkpoints, enqueues them, and dispenses them with a min-dwell. Returns `{ visible: ScrollEntry[], current: ScrollEntry | null }`. `visible` is every entry that has begun revealing; `current` is the latest.
2. **`<ScrollEntry>`** — renders one checkpoint as a story beat: year/age stamp, title, then bubbles staggered in. Owns its own animation timing relative to its `revealStartedAt`.
3. **`<StoryScroll>`** — composes the hook and renders entries in a scrolling column with the latest at the bottom and auto-scroll into view.

### Queue & advance logic

```
BUBBLE_STAGGER_MS = 700           // bubble-by-bubble reveal inside the active entry
READY_HINT_DELAY_MS = 600         // beat between last bubble and the "continue" hint
INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT_MS = 30_000    // demo safety: auto-advance if no input for 30s
```

- `useStoryQueue` keeps a ref'd queue of checkpoints that have arrived from `outline` but haven't started revealing yet.
- A checkpoint starts revealing when (a) it's first-in-queue, and (b) the user has signalled "advance" (or the inactivity timeout fires).
- The first event in the simulation auto-starts (no user action needed for the very first beat).
- Each subsequent event renders its bubbles at `BUBBLE_STAGGER_MS` intervals. When the last bubble lands, after `READY_HINT_DELAY_MS` the persistent advance dock (see "The advance affordance" below) flips into its "ready" state.
- The user advances by pressing **Right Arrow**, **Space**, or **Enter**, or by clicking the dock. Any of those dispenses the next item from the queue.
- If the queue is empty (the user is faster than the backend), the dock shows a quiet ellipsis state and the next event auto-starts as soon as it arrives.
- If the user takes no action for `INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT_MS` after the dock enters "ready", the next event auto-starts. This protects demos and abandoned sessions; the timeout is intentionally long.
- Multiple events arriving in a burst all land in the queue; the user paces them out. The constellation graph still pulses immediately on every raw `filledAt` so the SVG conveys "things are still arriving" — only the text reveal is gated.

### Scroll layout

Right column at phase 3:

```
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│ writing checkpoint 04 / 06     │  ← phase header (existing)
├────────────────────────────────┤
│                                │
│  2031 · age 27                 │  ← faded entry (op 0.35)
│  The job offer in Boston       │
│                                │
│  2034 · age 30                 │  ← faded entry (op 0.55)
│  A long Sunday with your sister│
│                                │
│  2037 · AGE 33                 │  ← active entry (op 1.0)
│  The promotion you didn't take │
│  "Rachel: 'You sure?'"         │
│  You sat with it three nights. │
│  Something quieter took root.  │
│                                │
└────────────────────────────────┘  ← latest is anchored to the bottom
```

- Scroll is **bottom-anchored**: the active (newest) entry sits near the bottom of the column. Older entries push upward as new ones arrive. Overflow off the top is hidden with a top-edge fade mask (linear gradient from transparent to background).
- Older entries fade by recency, not by index: opacity = `0.35 + 0.65 * (recency)` where `recency` is `1.0` for the active entry and decays per entry above. Concretely: active=1.0, prev=0.55, prev-1=0.35, prev-2..=0.25 (clamped).
- Older entries also collapse: only year/age stamp + title remain. Bubbles only render for the active entry. This keeps the column readable and prevents the panel from visually overflowing.
- Inside the active entry, bubbles still stagger in at `BUBBLE_STAGGER_MS` intervals using the same `now - revealStartedAt` math.

### Transitions

- New active entry: fades in over 600ms while shifting up ~14px from below (translateY).
- Previous active demotes to "older" state: bubbles collapse out (200ms fade + height collapse), color shifts from `--ink` to `--ink-2`, opacity drops.
- These run in parallel — the demotion of the old and the arrival of the new feel like a single page-turn, not two events.

### Typography hierarchy upgrade

Applies to the right column across all phases. Goal: the story column should feel like the primary reading surface, not a sidebar.

| Element                         | Before                              | After                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Phase header (`storyHeader`)    | `<Meta>` (mono, `--ink-3`)          | unchanged — it's the small label                            |
| Active entry: year/age stamp    | mono 10px, `--accent`               | mono 11px, `--accent`, +12% letter-spacing                  |
| Active entry: title             | serif 19px italic, `--ink`          | serif 22px italic, `--ink`, line-height 1.3                 |
| Active entry: speaker label     | mono 9px, `--accent` or `--ink-3`   | mono 10px, `--accent` or `--ink-2`                          |
| Active entry: quote bubble      | serif 16px, `--ink`                 | serif 18px, `--ink`, line-height 1.5                        |
| Active entry: narrator bubble   | serif 16px italic, `--ink-2`        | serif 17px italic, `--ink-1`, line-height 1.55              |
| Faded entry: title              | (n/a)                               | serif 16px italic, color modulated by recency               |
| Phase 1 agent name              | serif 19px italic, `--ink`          | serif 21px italic, `--ink`                                  |
| Phase 1 relationship line       | serif 14px italic, `--ink-2`        | serif 16px italic, `--ink-1`                                |
| Phase 2 hint                    | serif 16px italic, `--ink-1`        | serif 17px italic, `--ink-1`, line-height 1.45              |
| Right column width              | 360px                               | 420px                                                       |

Width bump (360 → 420) gives prose more room to breathe and signals the column's increased importance. The grid template becomes `minmax(0, 1fr) 420px`.

### Constellation behavior during the scroll

- **Constellation `activeIdx` is driven by the paced view, not raw `outline`.** When the text says "you sat with it three nights," the graph highlights the actors involved in *that* event, not the next one already buffered. The hook exposes `currentOutlineIdx` for the SVG to consume in place of the existing `activeIdx` derivation.
- Outline-arrival animation (the small "+ event" pulse on the year axis) still fires on raw `filledAt` — that's a "stream is alive" cue and we want it immediate.
- During phase 3, the constellation's overall opacity drops slightly (e.g. 0.85) so the text reads as foreground. One-time CSS opacity transition when entering phase 3, no per-frame work.
- The center node still labels with the user's name, unchanged.

### Phase transitions also wait for the user

The same "advance when ready" affordance gates the major phase transitions, not just event-to-event:

- **Phase 1 → 2:** When the cast list has fully appeared in the right column, the `next →` hint shows. User advances to begin phase 2 (visual transition; backend has already streamed the plan).
- **Phase 2 → 3:** When all plan hints have appeared, the hint shows. User advances to start the events scroll.
- **Phase 3 → 4 (finalizing):** After the *last* event is rendered AND the backend has emitted `finalizing`/`complete`, the hint shows. User advances into the finalizing meditation.
- **Phase 4 → next screen (reveal):** The existing "meet yourself →" button is the user's signal here, unchanged. The current 1.2–5s auto-advance is removed. The screen waits for an explicit click.

The `INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT_MS` safety net applies at every gate.

### Removed: the old auto-advance effect

The existing `useEffect` at `screens-a.tsx:755` (advance to reveal screen 1.2–5s after `complete`) is removed. The user controls the transition. This is the central change in tone — the screen is now patient.

## Data flow

```
/simulate stream → App.runSimulate → setOutline (existing)
                                   ↓
                          ScreenProcessing reads `outline` prop (existing)
                                   ↓
                          useStoryQueue(outline) — NEW
                                   ↓                      ↓
                          paced ScrollEntry list    constellation pulses
                                                    (uses raw outline,
                                                     unchanged)
```

`outline` is the source of truth. The hook derives a *paced view* of it for the text column. The graph keeps consuming `outline` directly so visual feedback to the SVG is immediate.

### The advance affordance — obvious but quiet

The user must be able to tell, without instruction, that they are in control of pacing. We achieve this with a **persistent dock** at the bottom of the right column rather than per-entry hints. One predictable place to look. Same design language as the rest of the screen — no buttons, no boxes, no badges.

```
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│ ...story scroll above...       │
│                                │
├────────────────────────────────┤
│ ──────                          │  ← thin breathing underline (state cue)
│ press space  ·  next →         │  ← mono 11px, --ink-2 when ready, --ink-3 when not
└────────────────────────────────┘
```

States:

| State                         | Underline                          | Text                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Streaming (auto, first event) | static, `--ink-3`                  | `streaming`                           |
| Bubbles revealing             | static, `--ink-3`                  | `revealing`                           |
| Ready for input               | breathing 1.6s, `--accent` tint    | `press space · next →`                |
| Queue empty (waiting backend) | static, `--ink-3`                  | `· · ·`                               |
| Final beat (advance to reveal)| breathing, `--accent`              | `press space · meet yourself →`       |

- The underline is a 24px-wide × 1px line that pulses opacity 0.3 → 1.0 → 0.3 over 1.6s when in a "ready" state. Static (opacity 0.4) otherwise. This is the only continuous animation in the dock — gentle, not flashy.
- `next →` is clickable; the entire dock area is hover/click-targeted so the user can mouse-click as well as keyboard.
- `space` is shown rather than `→` because Space is the dominant convention for "advance"; both are bound. Keep the text short.
- Position: anchored to the bottom of the right column with 18px padding above. Always present from the moment phase 1 begins, so the user sees the dock the entire time and learns its rhythm. It is not "introduced" mid-stream.
- Color: never above `--ink-2`. Never bold. Never larger than 11px. The dock should feel like the page-number area of a book — present, predictable, ignorable until needed.

This replaces the per-entry `next →` from the earlier draft. Per-entry hints would be repetitive noise; one persistent dock teaches the user the interaction once.

### Keyboard handling

The processing screen currently doesn't intercept keys; the App-level `onKey` handler (`App.tsx:321`) advances screens on `ArrowRight`/`ArrowLeft`. We need to override this *only on the processing screen* and *only while the queue is active*:

- `ArrowRight` / `Space` / `Enter` → dispense next entry in the queue. If the queue is empty AND we're at the final phase-4 gate, fall through to the default screen-advance behavior.
- `ArrowLeft` → unchanged; user can still navigate back if they want.

Implementation: the screen attaches its own keydown listener at `document` level, calls `e.stopPropagation()` and `e.preventDefault()` when it consumes the key. Cleanup on unmount.

## Error handling

- The error branch (`isError`) is unchanged — it shows the existing error panel, no scroll, no queue.
- If the queue has unrendered entries when an error arrives, the existing entries stay rendered with their normal manual-advance behavior so the user can still page through what arrived. The error banner appears above the scroll.

## Testing

- **Manual / browser:** `npm run dev`, run a simulation end-to-end.
  - Verify: phase 1 → all agents appear, hint shows, pressing Right advances to phase 2.
  - Verify: phase 2 → all hints appear, hint shows, pressing Space advances to phase 3.
  - Verify: phase 3 → first event auto-reveals, subsequent events wait for user input. No event is overwritten mid-reveal regardless of how fast the backend streams.
  - Verify: clicking `next →` and pressing Enter/Space/Right all advance.
  - Verify: older events remain visible above, faded.
  - Verify: text on the right reads as the focal element, not a sidebar.
  - Verify: 30s of inactivity at any gate auto-advances (test by waiting).
  - Verify: ArrowLeft still navigates back to a previous screen as before.
- **Typecheck:** `npm run typecheck` must pass clean.
- **No new unit tests** — the project does not currently have a frontend test harness; adding one is out of scope.

## Files changed

- `frontend/src/screens/screens-a.tsx` — extract phase-3 right-column into `StoryScroll`, `ScrollEntry`, add `useStoryQueue` hook with manual-advance gating, update typography in all four phases' right-column blocks, bump grid column width, remove the old auto-advance-to-reveal effect, drop constellation opacity at phase 3, attach screen-local keydown handler.
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` — minor: the screen-local keydown handler needs to win over the App-level Arrow listener while processing is active. Cleanest fix is to have the processing screen call `e.stopPropagation()`/`e.preventDefault()` on consumed keys; no changes to App.

That's it — effectively a single file. The file is already large (~1500 lines); we'll add ~200 lines net and may extract the new pieces to a sibling file `frontend/src/screens/processing-story.tsx` if it keeps the parent file from growing past comprehensibility. Decision deferred to implementation: if the new code lands cleanly under 120 lines, keep inline; if larger, split.

## Open questions

None blocking. The implementation plan will resolve the inline-vs-split decision based on the actual size of the diff.

## Out of scope

- Reordering phases or changing the streaming protocol.
- Changing the constellation graph layout or node behavior.
- Adding sound, voice narration, or other modalities to phase 3.
- Persisting the scroll for re-watching.
